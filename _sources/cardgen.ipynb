      "```{card} Answer\n",
      "No all quantum computer realisation methods require refridgeration and operation at extremely low temperatures. For instance, the superconducting approach requires refridgeration, while photonics or diamond-based approaches may be operated at room temperature.\n",

      "```{card} Answer\n",
      "Given the limitations of small and error-prone NISQ devices, software-based quantum simulators offer a valuable alternative for easier experimentation and skills development before transitioning to real hardware. Starting with simulators facilitates learning and development, providing a more accessible entry point compared to directly working with NISQ hardware.\n",
