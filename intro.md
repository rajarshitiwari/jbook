# QPCC's collection of Flashcards

```{admonition} About flashcards
:class: note
This is the landing page for the QPCC's collection of flashcards used as part of the teaching material. The flashcards shown here consists of `fronat and back` pairs, or alternatively `questions and answer` pairs, and are used to facilitate and encourage interaction with the cohorts about lecture specific topics.

We will display the card front, and first seek response and thoughts from the cohorts, then we reveal the back side. Remember that the answers themselve aren't that important, as is the discussion and the process of interaction. So please do not try to `learn` the answer beforehand! ðŸ˜ƒ

We have also added a dropdown list version of the same card below in the page.
