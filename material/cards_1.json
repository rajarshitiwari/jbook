        "back": "Given the limitations of small and error-prone NISQ devices, software-based quantum simulators offer a valuable alternative for easier experimentation and skills development before transitioning to real hardware. Starting with simulators facilitates learning and development, providing a more accessible entry point compared to directly working with NISQ hardware."
